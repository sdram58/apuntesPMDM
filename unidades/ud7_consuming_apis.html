    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    In this topic we will see how to obtain / send information from / to the Internet. For this we will use REST services
    <h3>What is an API Rest?</h3>
    <p>We could define REST API as a service that provides us with the functions we need to be able to obtain information from an external client, 
        such as a database hosted anywhere in the world from within our own application.</p>
    <p>Let's think about Instagram, an application with millions of users. It is not feasible to have the information of each user within the application, right? 
        Well, to solve the problem they use REST API services. The first thing we do when entering the app is a login, this would be the first of the services, 
        since we send the server the <span class="negrita">username</span>  and <span class="negrita">password</span>  and this would return the information that we 
        must show in the app.</p>

    <p>We have four different types of requests as a general rule.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="negrita">Get</span>: These are the simplest requests, <span class="subrayado">they only return information</span>. 
            If we need to pass a parameter to the request, it will be through the url. That is, if, for example, we have to make a request that depends on an id 
            (eg the user's identification), the url would be formed like this https://example.com/information/1, with 1 being the parameter that we pass to it. 
            The problem with this is that it is not very secure to pass sensitive information.</li>
        <li><span class="negrita">Post</span>: Similar to <span class="r-word">Get</span> but the parameters are not passed by url, so it is safer to send information.</li>
        <li><span class="negrita">Put</span>: It is usually used to <span class="subrayado">create</span>  the entity, that is, if we think of a service as access to a database, 
            this would create the user for example.</li>
        <li><span class="negrita">Delete</span>: It would be the last of the four that would allow us to <span class="subrayado">delete</span>  the records from the database</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>The information usually comes in two different formats, <span class="negrita">XML</span>  or <span class="negrita">JSON</span>. 
        In order not to get too deeply into the subject, we will only talk about <span class="negrita">JSON</span>, which is the most common format and with which 
        we are going to work.</p>
    
    <p class="sub-section">JSON format</p>
    <p><span class="r-word">Json</span>  is a simple text format, it is the acronym for <span class="negrita">JavaScript Object Notation</span>. 
        It is one of the standards for the transfer of information between platforms, it has a very legible form that allows us to understand its content without problem. 
        A simple example would be this.</p>

    <section><pre><code class="language-json">{
  "employees": [
    {
    "id": "1",
    "firstName": "Tom",
    "lastName": "Cruise",
    "photo": "https://jsonformatter.org/img/tom-cruise.jpg"
    },
    {
    "id": "2",
    "firstName": "Maria",
    "lastName": "Sharapova",
    "photo": "https://jsonformatter.org/img/Maria-Sharapova.jpg"
    },
    {
    "id": "3",
    "firstName": "Robert",
    "lastName": "Downey Jr.",
    "photo": "https://jsonformatter.org/img/Robert-Downey-Jr.jpg"
    }
]
}</code></pre>
    </section><br><br>

    <p>Every Json format begins and ends with braces and has a key-value. The employees key contains in turn a list of employee (note that instead of braces it has brackets), 
        which stores id, firstName, lastName and photo. Thus we can pass a large amount of information from one platform to another with some standards that help us 
        simplify the process.</p>
    
    <p>If it is still difficult for you to read these files at the beginning, we can make use of a multitude of websites that simplify the way of seeing it, such as

    <br>
    
    <p>There are many free APIs (some of them with registration) that we can make use of. It is enough to do a search in Google and find almost the theme that we are looking for.</p>
    
    <p>Here is a small list of APIs</p>
    
    
    <ul>
        <li><a class="enlace" target="_blank" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie?language=es-ES">API about movies</a> </li>
        <li><a class="enlace" target="_blank" href="https://swapi.dev/">API about StarWars</a> </li>
        <li><a class="enlace" target="_blank" href="https://developer.marvel.com/">API about Marvel</a> </li>
        <li><a class="enlace" target="_blank" href="https://www.weatherapi.com/">API about weather</a> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before starting to see how to access REST services, let's see how to obtain images from the internet from their URL.
    Before continuing, remember that if you want to use an image you must be authorized and respect the copyrights &copy; if you have them.
    Remember that by default, if not indicated otherwise, the resource is protected by copy right &copy;</p>
